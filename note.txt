We would like to collect data of Italian doctors from the fnomceo.it page.

Here is the search field => https://portale.fnomceo.it/cerca-prof/index.php

To get results you have to use phrases from the spreadsheet in “Cognome” field and click “Cerca” button => https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d8Rsm8GSA2ULUbIGaAlAtM9GW2rfmYXNzlZOUSsH4pI/edit?usp=sharing

We need data for each doctor from each listing page of results => https://monosnap.com/file/xQ9c1f4sByAgdShNPon7LssnEKKwZw

I think it should give us about 450k records.

Data of all doctors have to be collected in the Excel spreadsheet.
